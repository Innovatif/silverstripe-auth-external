Update instructions to go from 0.1 to 0.2/0.3
---------------------------------------------

The config file layout and database scheme changed from 0.1 to 0.2 or 0.3

-----------
If you update from 0.1 to 0.2 or 0.3 make sure you have a working admin account
stored in the database that can be used with the native authentication 
mechanism
-----------

Look to the examples in the doc directory for the exact changes.
In essence each source (multiple sources can be configured now) should start 
off with a createSource statement and all configuration settings should include
the source ID.

Database changes have a bigger impact. Run db/build?flush=1 after copying
the new version into your SilverStripe tree.

The log in with a local account and modify all accounts to include the 
authentication source you are using. (If you have only one source configured,
this comes down to opening and saving the account details.

Alternatively you could do this directly in sql. The extra column is called
'External_SourceID', but take care not to modify the accounts not coming from
the external authentication source.
