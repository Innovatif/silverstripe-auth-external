External Authentication Module
------------------------------

January 12, 2008

This module enables you to use external authentication sources for password
verification. At the moment this module has 4 drivers. LDAP, FTP, IMAP and 
HTTPBASIC. The IMAP driver also supports POP3. All drivers support SSL, TLS 
is only supported by the LDAP and IMAP drivers.

When you use this module you will still need to create accounts within 
SilverStripe. There will be two extra fields for each account, specifying the 
username and the external authentication source it comes from.

If you run your website at your ISP which also hosts your mailbox, you can use
the ISP's IMAP/POP3 server to validate your logon. Other users at the ISP 
cannot login when you do that, because the accounts also need to be registered
within SilverStripe.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
At least SilverStripe 2.3.0
Depending on the authentication driver you could need php modules like 
php-imap or php-ldap, OpenSSL libraries and/or some PEAR modules. These
extra requirements are documented in the configuration examples.
