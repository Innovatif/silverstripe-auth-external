External Authentication Module
------------------------------

November 3, 2007

This module enables you to use external authentication sources for password
verification. At the moment this module has 3 drivers. LDAP, FTP and IMAP. The
IMAP driver also supports FTP. All drivers support SSL, TLS is only supported
by the LDAP and IMAP drivers.

When you use this module you will still need to create accounts within 
SilverStripe. There will be an extra field for each account, specifying the 
username in the external authentication source.

If you run your website at your ISP which also hosts your mailbox, you can use
the ISP's IMAP/POP3 server to validate your logon. Other users at the ISP 
cannot login when you do that, because the accounts also need to be registered
within SilverStripe.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
At least SilverStripe 2.2.0


INSTALL
-------

1) Copy the auth_external directory into your mail SilverStripe directory
2) Create a proper _config.php file. You can start with the annotated examples
   from the doc directory
3) run /db/build  (like http://www.yourdomain.com/db/build)

You should now have an "External Account" tab on the admin page
