To do list for the External Authenticator
-----------------------------------------

[0.4.0]
- Authentication source selection based on client IP address

----- Ticket 3742----------------------
- Rename external ID to "source anchors"
- Allow users to login with e-mail address instead of source anchor
- Auto update e-mail address if changed (when logging in with source anchor or
  e-mail address)
- Auto-add for login with e-mail address (anchor has to be determined from
  source directly (LDAP) or given by user (other drivers))
---------------------------------------

- Deprecate sequential source checking (replaced with e-mail login)
- Tabs on login form

[other]
- OpenID client (auth_openid is not maintained any more)
- OpenID server (I hope I ever get around to do this)
- SMTP and/or other drivers, like Google/Yahoo mail (all)
- Create unittests for drivers
