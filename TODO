To do list for the External Authenticator
-----------------------------------------

- Authentication source selection based on client IP address
- OpenID client (auth_openid is not maintained any more)
- OpenID server (I hope I ever get around to do this)
- SMTP and/or other drivers, like Google/Yahoo mail (all)
- Create unittests for drivers
